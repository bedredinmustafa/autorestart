# autorestart
Batch File to Automatically Restart your PC Every X Seconds - Minutes

I needed this to Restart a device of mine every 2-3 Hours.
You can put it at the Windows Startup Shell and it will Start with the start your System, after the specified time the system will then Restart and so on.

All you have to do is to change Timeout to the Time you need it (convert hours/minutes to seconds).

It's Configured at 60 Seconds by default.
